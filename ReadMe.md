# 💭 Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This project consists of creating a Ruby ['Bubble-Sort' algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.htm) to sort an array in ascending order. This assignment focused on creating both a traditional 'bubble-sort' algorithm as well as one which uses *<yield>* to pass a block to our method.
